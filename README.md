# Fake-News-Detection-and-Translation
Spam email and Fake News have both steadily grown since the early 1990s and by 2014, spam email was estimated to account for around 90% of the total email traffic and hence the basic goal of our project becomes to design a fake news detection system from scratch using various NLP mechanisms.

We will be detecting Fake news by integrating the Linear Perceptron model of Machine Learning with Natural Language Processing and we will determine its accuracy by using a confusion matrix. This would enable the user to detect the fake news using an efficient algorithm and will also provide the user with the feature of translation as an added benefit.
